# STRUCS

A structure, written struct, is an efficient way to group several variable under one heading. The variables in a struct do not have to be of the same type-- multiple data types can be stores using struct. For example, we were asked to make a database of cars. Name, number of seats, cost and category of the car (character, integer, float and character type data respectively) were the variables under the heading of "Honda", which is a car brand. The structure stores user-input data.

  ...
}
